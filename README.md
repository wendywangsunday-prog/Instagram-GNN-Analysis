## File Description
- `directed graph.py`: Implements the construction and operations of directed graphs representing Instagram networks.
- `training.ipynb`: Demonstrates the data processing, model training, and result visualization within a Jupyter Notebook.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies needed for the project environment.
## Usage Instructions
1. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies with:

2. Open `training.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells to run the training and analysis pipeline.

3. The `directed graph.py` module is used within the notebook to provide graph-related functionalities.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
